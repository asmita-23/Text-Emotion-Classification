## 📊 **Example Dataset**
Here's a sample of how the model works and classifies text emotions:

| **Text**                         | **Predicted Emotion** |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| "I'm so happy today!"             | Joy                   |
| "I feel so frustrated right now." | Anger                 |
| "Life has been tough lately."     | Sadness               |
| "Wow! That's amazing news!"       | Surprise              |
